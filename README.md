First Project (Larger Project) – Survival Game

The game is a 2D open world survival experience set in a post-apocalyptic world with zombies. Most of the game world consists of forest, with scattered city locations to explore. There is a chance to encounter enemies when searching or entering locations, as well as a lower chance while moving around. Players need to manager hunger, water, and energy levels, which can be replenished by finding food water items. Movement is touch-based. Additionally, the game features an XP and levelling system, rewarding XP for battles, searching, movement, and crafting. As Players level up, their stats such as health and attack increase, while traits provide bonus effects at certain level milestones.
